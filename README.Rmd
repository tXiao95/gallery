# gallery

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of gallery is to replicate the [MATLAB gallery of test matrices](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/gallery.html) in R.

## Installation

You can install the released version of gallery from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("gallery")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
# library(gallery)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.
